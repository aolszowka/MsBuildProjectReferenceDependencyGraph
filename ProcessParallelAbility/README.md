# ProcessParallelAbility
Utility to perform further processing on a DOT Graph generated by `MsBuildProjectReferenceDependencyGraph`.

This utility answers the following question:

    In a breadth-first parallelization effort how many elements can be processed at once?

Consider the following dependency graph:

```
digraph {
A -> B
B -> C
D -> C
E
F -> B
}
```

In this example produces the following breadth-first tree in which elements can be processed in parallel with no dependencies between levels:

```
0 - C, E
1 - B, D
2 - A, F
```

In systems that utilize breadth-first paralleization, assigning more than 2 worker processes is wasted effort because at no point would more than 2 workers ever be utilized.

This can be used as a good gauge to understand the type of hardware that should be provisioned to handle building such projects.
